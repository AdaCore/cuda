# GNAT for CUDA

GNAT for CUDAÂ® is a toolsuite that compiles Ada and SPARK code directly to
NVIDIA GPUs. We leverage the CUDA toolsuite provided by NVIDIA in order to
create a toolsuite that follows the same programming principles that CUDA
developers are familiar with, while providing access to these mechanisms
through the Ada and SPARK programming languages.
