--  This body is specifically for using an Ada interface to C math.h to get
--  the computation engine. Many special cases are handled locally to avoid
--  unnecessary calls or to meet Annex G strict mode requirements.

--  Uses functions sqrt, exp, log, pow, sin, asin, cos, acos, tan, atan, sinh,
--  cosh, tanh from C library via math.h
