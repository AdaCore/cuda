Welcome to GNAT for CUDA®
**************************************

GNAT for CUDA® is a toolsuite for compiling Ada and SPARK code directly for
NVIDIA GPUs. This is achieved by leveraging the CUDA toolsuite that is
provided by NVIDIA. It is aimed at following the same programming principles
that CUDA developers are familiar with while providing access to these 
principles through the Ada and SPARK programming languages.

This document expects an advanced understanding of the CUDA toolsuite developed 
by NVIDIA, documented `here <https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/>`_.

Note that this product is currently under development. The work is presented
as a prototype to allow engineers to experiment with the capability. More 
features will be added and the list of limitations reduced as the program of 
work continues.
