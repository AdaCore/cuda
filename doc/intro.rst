Welcome to GNAT for CUDA®
**************************************

GNAT for CUDA®is a toolsuite that compilies Ada and SPARK code directly to
NVIDIA GPUs. We leverage the CUDA toolsuite provided by NVIDIA in order to
create a toolsuite that follows the same programming principles that CUDA
developers are familiar with while providing access to these mechanisms
through the Ada and SPARK programming languages.

This document assumes an advanced understanding of NVIDIA's CUDA
toolsuite, documented `here <https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/>`_.

This product is currently under development and is presented as a prototype
to allow engineers to experiment with its capabilities. More features will
be added and the list of limitations reduced as work continues.
